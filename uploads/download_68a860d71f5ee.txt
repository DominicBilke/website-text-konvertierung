Account Statement (Account Overview)
We ask you to check the account statement in accordance with Section 11, Paragraph 4 of our General Terms and Conditions.conditions (www.ing.de/agb/)
for completeness and accuracy and to notify us of any objections in writing immediately.

Account Statement Including Balance Notification

We ask you to check your account balance(s) and notify us of any objections in writing immediately, at the latest within 6 weeks of receipt. If no objections are raised within this period, the balance(s) listed above will be deemed to have been accepted by you in accordance with our General Terms and Conditions. You can request a correction of the account statement even after the deadline has expired, but you must then prove that your account was wrongfully debited or that a credit to which you are entitled was not issued.

Deposit Protection

As deposits, balances are eligible for compensation in accordance with the Deposit Protection Act. Further information
can be found in the "Information Sheet for Depositors" (see also www.ing.de/einlagensicherung).

In addition to the statutory deposit protection under the Deposit Guarantee Act, ING also participates in the Deposit Guarantee Fund of German Banks (Deposit Guarantee Fund). In accordance with its statutes, this fund protects deposits
up to the protection limits set out in Section 20 ("Protection of Deposits") of our General Terms and Conditions.

Further information on the protection of your deposits can be found at: www.ing.de/einlagensicherung.

Nominal Interest Rate and Effective Annual Rate of Interest (Change in Interest Rates)
The nominal interest rates for authorized overdrafts [overdraft facility] and tolerated overdrafts are variable. ING is authorized and obligated to adjust the interest rates in accordance with the following provisions. Changes in the European Central Bank's interest rate for main refinancing operations
(hereinafter referred to as the ECB interest rate) are decisive for adjustments. The differences existing on September 1, 2010, between the
nominal interest rates and the ECB interest rate (equivalence ratios) continue to apply. They amount to 8.0 percentage points for authorized overdrafts
[overdraft facility] and 11.5 percentage points for tolerated overdrafts.
ING reviews the development of the ECB interest rate on the 15th of each month (review date). Changes in the
ECB interest rate of at least 0.25 percentpoints (relevant change) compared to the level on September 1, 2010
or subsequently compared to the level at the time the last relevant ECB interest rate change was determined
entitle ING to adjust the borrowing rates in the event of increases and oblige ING to adjust the borrowing rates in the event of reductions. A
reduction in the borrowing rates must at least correspond to the reduction in the ECB interest rate. An increase
may not exceed the increase in the ECB interest rate. An interest rate adjustment takes effect three calendar months after the
review date, on the 15th of each month (adjustment date).
If ING does not exercise its right to increase
the borrowing rates or does not exercise it fully in the event of an increase in the ECB interest rate by at least 0.25 percentage points, the agreed equivalence ratios will be undercut to the benefit of the
customer. ING may make up for any unused increase on the 15th of each month, subject to compliance with the agreed equivalence ratios. In the event of a subsequent reduction in the ECB interest rate (relevant reduction), it is only obligated to reduce the debit interest rates if the difference of 8.0 percentage points (authorized overdraft [overdraft facility]) or 11.5 percentage points (permitted overdraft) existing within the agreed equivalence ratio would be exceeded.

ING will inform the customer in advance of any change in the debit interest rate. This information may also be provided via the account statement.

The debit interest rates and any unused increase in the ECB interest rate are set out in the List of Prices and Services. The ECB interest rate as of September 1, 2010, its development, and the development of any unused increase can be found at www.ing.de/zinsanpassungsklausel/.
